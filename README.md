## Chapter 5: Databases and Data Analytics

This chapter focuses on the organization and management of data using databases and analytics tools.

### Key Topics:

- **Databases**: Electronic systems used for storing and organizing data such as facts, observations, and multimedia files. Primary keys are often used to uniquely identify records.
- **Database Models**:
  - **Hierarchical Database**: Tree-like structure with a single parent per node.
  - **Network Database**: Multiple parent nodes, enabling many-to-many relationships.
  - **Relational Database**: Tables used to organize data.
  - **Multidimensional Database**: Adds dimensions for complex data relationships.
  - **Object-Oriented Database**: Data stored as objects, including both attributes and methods.
- **Role of Data Analysts**: Includes data cleaning, quality assessment, automation development, and overseeing the analytics process.
